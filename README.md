# Gettr<br>
Built by: Eric Paulin, Christian Manibusan, Angel Samora, Ethan E (The Elite Four)
## Description:
Gettr is a forum web application where users can interact and communicate with one another on projects and ideas they may have. What makes Gettr different from other web application forums is that it is specifically tailored towards California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) students and faculty. This can be seen with the color palette of the site, which uses the official school colors as well as with login, which requires users to use their csusm.edu email in order to join. On the site, users can create and delete forum posts as well as message other users if they wish to discuss a project more privately. The app is also responsive meaning it will work on both a personal computer and/or mobile device.
## Tools Used:
Java, Spring Boot, Javascript, React.JS, MySQL.
